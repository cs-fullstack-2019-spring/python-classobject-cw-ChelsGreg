Start with a main function and make each problem a function. Call those functions from your main function.

### Problem 1:
Create a class Dog. Make sure it has the attributes name, breed, color, gender. Create a function that will print all attributes of the class. Create an object of Dog in your problem1 function and print all of it's attributes.

### Problem 2:
##### We will keep having this problem until EVERYONE gets it right without help
Create a function that has a loop that quits with the equal sign. If the user doesn't enter the equal sign, ask them to input another string.

### Problem 3:
In your main file create three Person objects. Change the weight and height of each one. Afterwards, print the BMI (body mass index) of each Person. If you donâ€™t know how to calculate BMI, look at the code I provided for you.

<strong>Hint</strong>: BMI is (weight / (height * height)) x 703. Weight is in pounds and height is in inches.

<strong>Extra</strong>:Put the three person objects in an array and use a loop to print out their BMIs.

### Problem 4:
Create a class Product that represents a product sold online. A product has a name, price, and quantity.

The class should have changeProduct:

a) If changeProduct has one parameter, it can change the name of the product.

b) If changeProduct has two parameters it can change the name and price of the product.

c) If changeProduct has three parameters it can change the name, price, and quantity of the product. 

Create an object of Product in your problem4 function and print all of it's attributes.
